# Buzzmaniam

**Buzzmaniam** is a **read-only, zero-trust analysis system** that inspects  
**Android application artifacts** and **wireless broadcasts (BLE)** to detect:

- Silent components
- Identity inconsistencies
- Spoofing indicators

The system operates **without intrusion**, **without device control**, and **without accessing private data**.

---

## Core Principles
- Read-only observation
- Zero-trust assumptions
- Artifact-first analysis
- Signal correlation (no connections)
- Policy-based decisions

---

## What It Analyzes
- Android APK structure (DEX count, native libraries, permissions)
- BLE broadcast metadata (public advertisements only)
- Cross-source correlation for anomaly indicators

---

## What It Does NOT Do
- No rooting
- No pairing or authentication
- No packet injection
- No password, file, or contact access
- No remote control

---

## Run (One Command)
```bash
bash run.sh
